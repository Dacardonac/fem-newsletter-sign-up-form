## My process 🎓

### Built with 🛠

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- CSS3 Custom Properties
- Mobile-first Workflow
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend Tooling
- [Sass/Scss](https://sass-lang.com/) - Modules
- [BEM Methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) - Nomenclature for Classes

### What I learned 🧠

With this project I learned, implemented and practiced Javascript, along with its properties and methods for alerts or success messages when submitting the form. I also reinforced and practiced my knowledge of CSS3 with Sass, I worked on semantic HTML5 while applying the BEM methodology for class naming and on my own I wanted to manage the data collected from the form in a JSON file, thus simulating a database with json-server.

**You can see an example below:**

``` JavaScript

```

### Continued development 🔎

With this path, I want to continue learning more about **JavaScript**, **Responsive Design** and how to work across different devices with **Flexbox** and **Grid**, also I want continue using  **BEM methodology** and perfect the technique in aspects like name the classes, also I want to improve in modularize the component's styles with **Sass** and learn about **Conventional Commits**.
